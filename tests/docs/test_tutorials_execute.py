"""Execute every docs/tutorials notebook end-to-end and let its asserts judge it.

The tutorials are linear scripts whose embedded ``assert`` statements are the
oracle (e.g. ``assert stretch / com == pytest.approx(np.sqrt(3))``).
``tools/build_tutorial_notebooks.py``
copies each ``` ```python ``` block verbatim into a notebook cell, so executing the
Markdown blocks in order — sharing one namespace, exactly as a notebook kernel
does — is a faithful test of what a reader runs on Colab.

This is the guard the ``notebooks`` freshness job does NOT provide: ``--check``
only verifies ``notebook == regeneration``, never *runs* the code. Running these
caught real latent errors the test suite had never executed (tutorials are not
otherwise collected by pytest).

Each tutorial runs from a fresh temporary working directory: a Colab user has no
repository checkout, so a tutorial that reads a repo-relative file would fail
here — which is exactly the regression we want to catch.

Marked ``tutorial`` and skipped without the ``[plot]`` extra (the tutorials
``import matplotlib``); CI runs them in a dedicated job that installs it.
